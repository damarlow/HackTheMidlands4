This is the plan for HackTheMidlands 4.0
----------------------------------------


1. Attend Opening Ceremony
2. Look around the sponsor stands, if anything jumps out project-wise, I may pick something to do.
3. Stick around for a bunch of workshops
4. Head back home in evening
5. Return Sunday Morning, attend closing ceremony
